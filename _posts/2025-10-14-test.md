title: "Black Hole Analogs & Horizon Physics"
---


Black holes prove to be an increasingly fascinating rabbithole for me. The idea that through Einstein's field equations you can have solutions that permit regions of space dominated by a *singularity* and shielded from view via the *event horizon*(the region of space where the singularities gravitational influence causes an acceleration of infalling matter exceeding the speed of light) is an idea so absurd in the abstract that Einstein himself failed to consider its physicality. Alot of focus is given to the singularity and while it is an area of immense theoretical potential it is inaccesible by all modes of measure as it hides behind the event horizon, this proves frusturating as in physics there exists a contemporary tension between **Quantum Field Theory** & **General Relativity** as to what the fundamental nature of gravity is. 


They are both highly succesful and celebrated theories and yet they give **fundamentally** incompatible answers to the question of "*how does gravity behave on the scale of quantum mechanics?*". This is where black holes shine, they act as stress tests for both the relativistic theory and the quantum theory simultaneously, however, given that the singularity is irrevocably hidden behind the horizon it might seem as though all progress in our understandings of black holes are hopelessly locked away but this isn't the case. I was reading a paper by Unruh & Wald in which they discuss what the vacuum would appear to be for an accelerating observer far out in flat space, the conclusion is fascinating, an accelerated observer would measure the vacuum to have *thermality* and they would be able to physcially justify this result both through relativity and quantum mechanics. Admittedly the math used in the paper got to be too much for me towards the end and I couldn't find any useful supplemental materials from either author as quite literally everything that Unruh and Wald have ever written are above anything I can currently follow through, however I was able to write code using these principles(more on that later).


Nevertheless I include a (crude) derivation:

$$ t = \xi \sinh\!\Bigl(\frac{a\tau}{c}\Bigr) \qquad x = \xi \cosh\!\Bigl(\frac{a\tau}{c}\Bigr) \qquad \xi > 0 $$

Above we have what a uniformly accelerated observer with hyperbolic acceleration would use where $$\xi$$ is the greek letter "*Xi*" representing how far the observer measures their own horizon to be, this then tranforms their flat-space metric to become approximately(near the horizon):

$$ ds^2 = - (a\xi)^2 c^2\, d\tau^2 + d\xi^2 $$

We then use a "Wick rotation" which will transform our time to an imaginary time, this allows us to treat time as an extra spatial dimension, allowing for a vast simplification in compute time. Note that it's analogous to the polar-coordinate form of the metric.

$$ ds^2 = (a\xi c)^2\ dt_E^2 + d\xi^2 $$

$$ ds^2 = r^2\ d\theta^2 + dr^2 $$

One consequence of turning our our time into an imaginary spatial component is that we must now account for its periodicity $$\beta$$.

$$ \beta = \frac{2\pi c}{a} $$ 

Note that the $$2\pi$$ is a direct consequence of the polar-coordinate analog from earlier.


Next we use a known result from quantum mechanics, the correlation between imaginary-time periodicity and thermal states.

$$ T = \frac{1}{k_B \beta} $$

We then substitute the $$\beta$$ we obtained before to acheive the Unruh thermality:

$$\boxed{\ T_U = \frac{\hbar a}{2\pi c k_B}\}$$

Note the $$\hbar$$, this is a consequence of translating a time periodicity into an energy scale via the relation:

$$ e^{-i H t / \hbar} $$
