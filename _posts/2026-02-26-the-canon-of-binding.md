This is the short version of it. I'm working on the bigger one.

**1.** **Any philosophy of consequence that does not begin with Binding has already begun too late.**

**2.** Binding is the event in which a distinction becomes a constraint that can still bind later even if the binder wishes otherwise.

**3.** A distinction counts as Binding only if it can make a later state count as breach, error or debt relative to it.

**4.** A binder is any locus where what it distinguishes can bind back upon it as constraint.

**5.** Where there is no Binding, there may be occurrence and salience but nothing truly counts or costs, no commitment can hold, no obligation can return and no return exists in the canonical sense.

**6.** When Binding persists, it leaves Ledger, meaning the constraint is carried forward so that breach, error or debt can remain in force across time.

**7.** When Binding stabilizes into routing force, it becomes Lock, meaning the carried constraint now constrains what futures are actually available.

**8.** Every Lock forecloses incompatible continuations and this foreclosure is Maim, which is structural unrecoverability produced by determinacy.

**9.** Foreclosure never abolishes its remainder because the excluded branch remains structurally indexable as what the Lock forbids.

**10.** Under persistence, remainder becomes return-bearing as a boundary-indexed pressure pattern and this return-behavior is Jinn.

**11.** Jinn is imposed rather than hidden because it is not primarily repressed content but the return-behavior of constraint when the present re-approaches a foreclosed boundary.

**12.** Under Jinn-pressure, binders bottle by forcing an impossible equality where either remainder must be zero in the Sacred form or binding must be zero in the Cynical form and self, agency, meaning, truth-talk, duty, regret and responsibility are later formations downstream of Binding.
