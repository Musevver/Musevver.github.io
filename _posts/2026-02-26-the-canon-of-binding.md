This is the short version of it. I'm working on the bigger one.

**1.** Any philosophy of consequence that does not begin with Binding has already begun too late.

**2.** $\color{#D97757}{\text{Binding}}$ is the event in which a distinction becomes consequential for the distinguisher.

**3.** A binder is whatever can be bound by what it distinguishes.

**4.** Where there is no Binding, there may be occurrence but there is no count, no cost, no commitment and no return.

**5.** Binding that persists leaves $\color{#D97757}{\text{Ledger}}$. This is consequence carried forward.

**6.** Binding that stabilizes becomes $\color{#D97757}{\text{Lock}}$. This is consequence that continues to bind.

**7.** Every Lock forecloses incompatible continuations. This foreclosure is $\color{#D97757}{\text{Maim}}$. It is structural unrecoverability.

**8.** Foreclosure never abolishes its remainder.

**9.** Under persistence, remainder becomes return-bearing as pressure. This return is $\color{#D97757}{\text{Jinn}}$.

**10.** Jinn is not primarily the return of repressed psychic content but the return-pressure of foreclosed possibility.

**11.** When Binding seeks escape from its own remainder, it bottles. When it tries to ground itself from nowhere, it enters $\color{#D97757}{\text{Gafol}}$. Gafol is the attempt to stand outside Binding and explain it from beyond its own condition.

**12.** Self, agency, meaning, truth, duty, regret and responsibility are not primitive. They are later formations within Binding.
